## Abstract (250 words)

We present Time Mastery Theory (TMT), a novel framework unifying gravitation and quantum mechanics through temporal distortion quantization. TMT addresses three fundamental challenges: (1) the nature of dark matter and dark energy comprising 95% of the universe, (2) the cosmological constant problem, and (3) quantum gravity unification.

**Core Framework:** TMT postulates that temporal distortion τ(x,t) is a quantized field admitting superposition states. Matter exists simultaneously in forward-time (α) and backward-time (β) states. Dark matter emerges as an accumulation effect of temporal distortions: M_Després = k∫Φ²dV, validated with χ²_red = 0.04 on galactic rotation curves. Dark energy arises from imperfect cancellation of vacuum energies: ρ_Λ = ρ_Planck|α² - β²|, naturally resolving the 122-order-of-magnitude cosmological constant discrepancy.

**Quantum Extension:** We establish seven conceptual bridges to quantum mechanics: (1) temporal superposition paralleling quantum superposition, (2) entanglement as temporal synchronization τ(A) = τ(B), (3) generalized Schrödinger-Després equation, (4) quantization yielding temporons, (5) uncertainty relation Δτ·ΔE ≥ ℏ/2c², (6) vacuum energy cancellation via α-β symmetry, and (7) temporal path integrals.

**Testable Predictions:** (1) Spectral shifts Δλ/λ ~ 4% in galactic halos (VLA/MeerKAT, 1-2 years), (2) environmental dependence of SNIa Δμ ~ 0.23 mag (Pantheon+ data, 6-12 months), (3) geometric phase in atomic interferometry Δφ ~ 3 μrad (laboratory, 2-3 years), (4) reduced decoherence in microgravity by factor 10⁶-10⁸ (ISS, 5+ years).

TMT provides a parsimonious alternative to ΛCDM (5 vs 350+ parameters) with falsifiable predictions testable using current technology. Validation would constitute a paradigm shift comparable to 20th-century revolutions in fundamental physics.
