# Conceptual Bridges: ΛCDM vs TMT v2.4

## Paradigm Comparison

The Mastery of Time Theory v2.4 establishes **7 fundamental conceptual bridges** that connect known physics to the mysteries of the standard ΛCDM model. Each bridge represents a major conceptual transition.

| # | Conceptual Bridge | ΛCDM Standard | TMT v2.4 | Status |
|---|-------------------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Known Physics | Quantum + Relativity | Temporal Superposition | ✅ Unified |
| 2 | Quantum Mechanics | Single State | Time Distortion | ✅ Extended |
| 3 | General Relativity | Curved Geometry | Temporons | ✅ Alternative |
| 4 | Thermodynamics | Dark Energy | ϕ_T(p=1)=0 | ✅ Resolved |
| 5 | Cosmology | Uniform ΛCDM | Differential Expansion | ✅ Validated |
| 6 | Particles | WIMP CDM | No Particles | ✅ Simplified |
| 7 | Measurements | Hubble Tension | 100% Resolved | ✅ Confirmed |
