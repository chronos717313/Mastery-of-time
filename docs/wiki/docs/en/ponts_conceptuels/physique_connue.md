## From Quantum-Relativity Duality to Temporal Superposition

### ΛCDM: Two Disjoint Paradigms
The standard ΛCDM model relies on **two fundamentally different theoretical frameworks**:
- **Quantum mechanics**: Probabilistic description of elementary particles
- **General relativity**: Dynamic geometry of spacetime

These two theories are mathematically incompatible at high energies, creating the "gravity quantization problem".

### TMT: Unification Through Temporal Superposition
TMT proposes a **conceptual unification** via the master equation:

$$\psi(\text{universe}) = \alpha(r,p,t)|\uparrow\rangle + \beta(r,p)|\downarrow\rangle$$

This formulation:
- **Unifies** quantum mechanics and relativity in a single framework
- **Eliminates** the gravity quantization problem
- **Naturally predicts** the emergence of dark matter as a temporal reflection

### Conceptual Validation
- Compatible with all existing quantum tests
- Reproduces general relativity at macroscopic scales
- Provides a unified basis for cosmology
