## Overview

Within the framework of the Theory of Time Mastery, **dark matter** is not an exotic form of invisible matter, but rather an **emergent effect** resulting from the accumulation and interaction of temporal distortion lines in spacetime.

**Terminology**: We use the term **Després Mass** to quantify the apparent equivalent mass at temporal distortion accumulation points (what Lambda-CDM calls "dark matter"). The **Després Mapping** provides Lorentz values (γ_Després) at every point in space.

## 1. Definition of Dark Matter and Després Mass

### Fundamental Statement

**Dark matter is a manifestation of accumulation points of temporal distortion lines, analogous to gravitational Lagrange points.**

The **Després Mass** quantifies this manifestation as an **equivalent mass**: M_Després = M_observed - M_baryonic

### Key Characteristics

**Nature**:
- Not a particle or material substance
- But a **geometric effect** of temporal distortion
- Points where temporal distortion gradients add up and accumulate
- The **Després Mass** represents the equivalent mass of this geometric effect

**Analogy with Lagrange Points**:
- Just as Lagrange points are zones of gravitational equilibrium
- "Després Mass points" are zones of temporal distortion accumulation
- These zones create apparent gravitational effects equivalent to a mass M_Després

## 2. Asselin Link - The Fundamental Mechanism

### Definition

**The Asselin Link represents the difference or average of temporal distortion values between two spatial zones.**

### Mathematical Formulation

For two regions of space A and B:

```
Asselin_Link(A,B) = |τ(A) - τ(B)|
```

Or, in averaged version:

```
Asselin_Link(A,B) = (τ(A) + τ(B)) / 2
```

Where:
- `τ(A)` = temporal distortion in region A
- `τ(B)` = temporal distortion in region B

### Physical Interpretation

- **Difference**: Measures the temporal distortion gradient between two zones
- **Average**: Measures the average level of temporal coupling between two regions
- The stronger the link, the more temporally "bound" the two regions are

### Link Properties

1. **Symmetry**: Asselin_Link(A,B) = Asselin_Link(B,A)
2. **Non-locality**: The link exists even at great distances
3. **Cumulative**: Links accumulate with the number of massive objects
4. **Horizon**: Limited by the gravitational horizon c/H₀

## 3. Després Mapping

### Definition

**The Després Mapping is a cartographic system that provides Lorentz values (γ_Després factor) at every point in space, linking Kepler's 3rd law with gravitational effects.**

### Concept

The Després Mapping is a **cartographic tool** that assigns to each point in space a generalized Lorentz value quantifying:

1. **The Lorentz factor γ_Després(r)** - primary value provided by the mapping
2. **The temporal distortion** τ(r) - integrated into γ_Després
3. **The connection with Keplerian dynamics** - v(r) according to Kepler's 3rd law

### Formulation

The Lorentz factor in the presence of gravitation is:

```
γ(r) = 1 / √(1 - v²(r)/c²)
```

Where v(r) is the orbital velocity according to Kepler's 3rd law.

**Modification proposed by the Després Mapping**:

```
γ_Després(r) = 1 / √(1 - v²(r)/c² - 2Φ(r)/c²)
```

Where:
- `Φ(r)` = effective gravitational potential including temporal distortion effect
- This additional term captures cumulative temporal distortion

### Temporal Distortion Index

The Després Mapping assigns to each point (r, θ, φ) in a gravitational system:

```
TDI(r, θ, φ) = γ_Després(r, θ, φ) - 1
```

Where:
- TDI = Temporal Distortion Index
- TDI = 0 → no distortion (flat spacetime)
- TDI > 0 → significant temporal distortion

## 4. Link with Dark Matter and Generation of Després Mass

### Després Mass Emergence Mechanism

**Step 1**: Baryonic matter creates a local temporal distortion τ(r) = GM/(rc²) ∝ 1/r

**Step 2**: Asselin Links connect different regions with temporal distortions

**Step 3**: The Després Mapping reveals accumulation zones:
- The total distortion gradient increases
- The γ_Després value becomes locally elevated
- The Temporal Distortion Index (TDI = γ_Després - 1) increases
- These zones create an **apparent gravitational effect**

**Step 4**: These accumulation zones constitute the **Després Mass**:
- They influence galactic rotation curves (elevated velocities)
- They stabilize large-scale structures (cosmic filaments)
- They emit no radiation (geometric effect, not particles)
- Their equivalent mass M_Després is measurable through gravitational effects

### Master Equation

The equivalent Després Mass in region R:

```
M_Després(R) = k_Asselin · ∫∫∫ |∇γ_Després(r')|² dV'
```

Where:
- `M_Després` = equivalent mass (effect of cumulative temporal distortion)
- `k_Asselin` = coupling constant (calibrated from observations)
- `γ_Després` = Lorentz values given by the Després Mapping
- The integral is over the considered volume

## 5. Observational Applications

### A) Galactic Rotation Curves

**Observed Problem**: Stars at galaxy peripheries rotate too fast for the visible baryonic mass.

**Explanation via Després Mass**:
1. The galactic center creates strong temporal distortion
2. This distortion propagates as τ(r) = GM/(rc²) ∝ 1/r (consistent with GR)
3. Cumulative Asselin Links create additional gravitational effect at periphery
4. The Després Mapping reveals elevated γ_Després values even at large distances
5. These γ_Després values generate an **equivalent Després Mass** M_Després
6. The total observed mass = M_baryonic + M_Després explains the elevated velocities

**Testable Prediction**:
```
v(r)² = GM_visible/r + Δv²(r)
```

Where:
```
Δv²(r) ∝ ∫∫∫ τ(r') · Asselin_Link(r, r') dV'
```

### B) Galaxy Clusters

**Observation**: Galaxy clusters show gravitational lensing effects exceeding visible baryonic mass.

**Explanation via Després Mass**:
- Each cluster galaxy creates temporal distortion
- Asselin Links between all galaxies accumulate
- The Després Mapping shows very high γ_Després values at the center
- These values correspond to significant **Després Mass** (M_Després ≈ 4 × M_baryonic)
- The total mass (M_baryonic + M_Després) curves spacetime → gravitational lensing

### C) Cosmic Filaments

**Observation**: Matter organizes into filaments at large scales.

**Explanation via Després Mass**:
- Filaments are **temporal distortion accumulation lines**
- Where Asselin Links between clusters are strongest
- The Després Mapping reveals elevated γ_Després values along the filaments
- This local increase in γ_Després creates a **linear Després Mass**
- Baryonic matter is attracted to these Després Mass zones
- Result: observed filamentary structure of the universe

## 6. Differences from Lambda-CDM Model

| Aspect | Lambda-CDM | Theory of Time Mastery |
|--------|-----------|------------------------|
| **Nature** | Exotic particle (WIMP, axion...) | **Després Mass** = geometric effect of temporal distortion |
| **Quantification** | Real mass M_dark (particles) | **Equivalent mass** M_Després = M_observed - M_baryonic |
| **Direct detection** | Expected (underground detectors) | Impossible (no particle, geometric effect) |
| **Spatial distribution** | NFW halo (N-body simulations) | Accumulation points according to Asselin Links |
| **Mapping** | Numerical simulations | **Després Mapping**: γ_Després(r) values |
| **Link with visible matter** | None (except gravitation) | Direct Asselin Link (temporal gradient) |
| **Testable predictions** | Annihilation, scattering | Halo asymmetry, θ_halo ↔ θ_neighbor correlation |

## 7. Unique and Testable Predictions

### Prediction 1: Després Mass Halo Asymmetry

**Lambda-CDM**: Spherical and symmetric dark matter halo (NFW)

**Time Mastery**: Asymmetric **Després Mass halo** following Asselin Links
- Després Mass halos should be elongated toward massive neighboring galaxies
- Shape depends on Asselin Links with environment
- **Decisive test**: Correlation θ_halo ↔ θ_neighbor > 0.5 (TM) vs ≈ 0 (LCDM)

### Prediction 2: Després Mass - Environment Correlation

**Prediction**: The **Després Mass** M_Després in a galaxy depends on its environment:
- Isolated galaxies: low M_Després (few Asselin Links)
- Cluster galaxies: high M_Després (numerous cumulative links)
- Quantitative relation: M_Després ∝ ∑ᵢ (M_neighbor,i / d_neighbor,i)

**Test**: Analyze M_Després / M_baryonic ratio as a function of galactic environment

### Prediction 3: Temporal Signature

**Prediction**: Zones of strong temporal distortion accumulation should show:
- Measurable temporal shifts (atomic clocks)
- Anomalies in periodic signals (pulsars)

**Test**: Precise timing of pulsars in different galactic regions

## 10. Conclusion

The reinterpretation of dark matter as **Després Mass** (equivalent mass at temporal distortion accumulation points) offers:

1. An elegant geometric explanation (effect, not particle)
2. A direct link with General Relativity (τ = Φ/c²)
3. Unique testable predictions (halo asymmetry)
4. A conceptual unification with dark energy

The three key concepts:

- **Després Mass** = Equivalent mass M_Després = M_observed - M_baryonic (quantifies the "dark matter" effect)
- **Asselin Link** = Temporal distortion gradient |τ(A) - τ(B)| (generating mechanism)
- **Després Mapping** = Lorentz values γ_Després(r) at every point (mapping of the effect)

**Hierarchy**: Asselin Links → Després Mapping (γ_Després) → Després Mass (M_Després)

This approach now requires:
- Complete mathematical formalization (integral equations)
- Numerical calculations for rotation curves (k_Asselin calibration)
- Decisive test: θ_halo ↔ θ_neighbor correlation with UNIONS data

**Next steps**:
1. Develop complete equations
2. Calculate a concrete galactic rotation curve
3. Identify the most easily testable prediction
4. Submit for review by theoretical physicists
