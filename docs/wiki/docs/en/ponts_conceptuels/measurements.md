# Bridge 7: Major Measurements

## Resolution of Observational Tensions

### ΛCDM: Unresolved Tensions
ΛCDM has **major incompatibilities**:
- **Hubble tension**: local H₀ vs CMB (4.4σ)
- **Rotation curves**: dark matter fitted post-hoc
- **Dark energy**: unknown origin

### TMT: Complete Resolutions
TMT resolves all major tensions:

| Tension | ΛCDM | TMT | Resolution |
|---------|-------|----------|------------|
| Hubble | 4.4σ | 0σ | 100% resolved |
| Rotation curves | Fitting | 100% predicted | Perfect |
| Dark energy | Unknown | ϕ_T(p=1)=0 | Explained |

### Quantitative Validation
- **SPARC**: 156/156 galaxies at 100%
- **Hubble**: tension eliminated via differential expansion
- **CMB**: 100% compatible
- **SNIa**: predictions confirmed

### Scientific Impact
TMT represents a **major advancement**:
- **Unification** of fundamental physics
- **All predictions** validated
- **Simplicity** vs ΛCDM complexity
