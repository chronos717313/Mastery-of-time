# Core Concepts - Time Mastery Theory

## Basic Principles

### 1. Relativity of Motion (Founding Principle)
**Statement**: Nothing is motionless in the universe; all motion is relative to other objects.

**Implications**:
- All reference frames are in motion relative to each other
- The notion of "absolute rest" does not exist
- Each object exists in a network of dynamic relationships with all other objects

### 2. Asselin Link - Infinite Range Gravitation

**Statement**: Gravitation is infinitely non-zero and does not stop at visible attraction. Celestial bodies maintain influences on each other at all distances.

**Key concept**:
- Unlike the classical Newtonian view where gravity diminishes as 1/r², gravitational influence never truly becomes zero
- Links persist even at cosmological distances
- These "residual" links could explain phenomena currently attributed to dark matter

**Questions to develop**:
- [ ] How does the Asselin Link behave at large distances? (Slower decay than 1/r²?)
- [ ] Is there a threshold where the effect becomes dominant compared to classical gravitation?
- [ ] How do these links accumulate at galactic/cosmological scales?

### 3. Differential Void Expansion (Origin of Dark Energy)

**Statement**: Dark energy would be partly caused by the void expanding faster in the absence of matter versus where matter is located.

**Key concept**:
- The quantum vacuum expands at a different rate depending on the presence/absence of matter
- Zones with matter: slowed expansion (braked by the presence of mass-energy)
- Zones without matter (cosmic voids): accelerated expansion
- This difference creates an expansion gradient that could generate the observed dark energy effect

**Questions to develop**:
- [ ] What is the physical mechanism by which matter slows local expansion?
- [ ] How to quantify this difference in expansion rate?
- [ ] Is this related to temporal distortion (matter slows local time)?
- [ ] How does this affect the large-scale structures of the universe?

## Connection Between Concepts

**Working Hypothesis**:
The presence of matter creates a local temporal distortion that:
1. Slows the expansion of the void in that region
2. Maintains gravitational links (Asselin Link) with other matter regions
3. Creates a network of temporal connections across the universe

**Observed result**:
- Cosmic voids expand more rapidly → macroscopic dark energy effect
- Links maintained between galaxies → dark matter effect (rotation curves)

## Next Steps for Formalization

1. **Mathematically define** temporal distortion in the presence of matter
2. **Quantify** the difference in expansion rate void vs matter
3. **Model** the Asselin Link and its decay with distance
4. **Calculate** observable predictions (rotation curves, cosmic expansion)
