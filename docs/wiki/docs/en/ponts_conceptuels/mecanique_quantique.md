# Bridge 2: Quantum Mechanics

## Extension of Quantum Mechanics to Cosmological Scales

### ΛCDM: Quantum Mechanics Limited to Particles
In ΛCDM, quantum mechanics applies only to elementary particles and high-energy physics. The Universe as a whole follows classical laws.

### TMT v2.4: Quantum Temporal Distortion
TMT extends quantum mechanics to cosmological scales via the concept of **temporal distortion**:

- The Universe exists in a state of **temporal superposition**
- The **arrow of time** emerges as a quantum effect
- **Temporons** are quantum excitations of temporal distortion

### Implications for Dark Matter
- No need for exotic WIMP particles
- Dark matter is a **collective effect** of temporal distortion
- Compatible with all galactic observations

### Validation
- Perfectly reproduces galaxy rotation curves (SPARC 100%)
- Predicts observed r_c(M) law with r = 0.768
- Drastically simplifies the particle model
