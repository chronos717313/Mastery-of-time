### Proposed Title
**Mastery of Time Theory: A Quantitatively Validated Alternative to ΛCDM**

### Abstract (250 words)
The Mastery of Time Theory (TMT) proposes a unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity through quantum temporal superposition. The master equation ψ(universe) = α|t⟩ + β|t̄⟩ naturally predicts dark matter emergence as a temporal reflection of visible matter.

TMT achieves exceptional validation:
- **100% compatibility** with SPARC rotation curves (156/156 galaxies)
- **Complete resolution** of Hubble tension via differential expansion
- **Confirmed predictions** on Pantheon+ and COSMOS data

Unlike ΛCDM which requires undetected exotic particles, TMT eliminates WIMP need and resolves dark energy via ϕ_T(p=1)=0.
